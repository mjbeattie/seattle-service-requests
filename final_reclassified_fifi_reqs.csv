205933365," Dear Mayor Durkan, I have worked in the old Cress building at Third and Pike before the new QFC moved in and now I travel through the neighborhood on my way for volunteer work at the Aquarium and my frequent trips to the Market. It has always been a ""tough"" intersection but now I find myself avoiding it entirely because of the filth that has accumulated on the sidewalks in resent weeks and over the last couple of months it seems. I realize that it is an important intersection for the homeless as there is the QFC and Starbucks and transit available there. The checkers in the QFC told me the cleaning of the sidewalk is not their problem as there is supposed to be street cleaners in that neighborhood. The recent cold weather has made this an incredibly unpleasant area. I feel that this area needs immediate attention. I cannot blame the homeless but something has to be done to keep this area clean. I am sure it is attracting rats and further filth. Can the City provide more cleaners in this area, or provide garbage bags and pickup for the ""residence"" to self clean and then provide some guidance to them to help, and make contact with the store owners to provide some effort to keep this area clean. It seems to me the stores, the GFC and Starbucks, and the restaurants on Pike, are deliberately not cleaning in the hopes that the filth will drive away the street people. That doesn't work. It is a downright eyesore and does not look good to the residence of the neighborhood or to the tourists going to the Market. What can I do to help.",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

He said he is interested in starting or working with a non-profit to pay those fees.  How should he get started in working with the City on this idea?  He also said he recently entered PDR # C072839-040721 to find out how much funds Seattle collects from PDRs - to see if this is a feasible idea.",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

Taylor said Ofc Dornay stayed in touch with her and, nine days later, returned Terra with a new sweater and a grooming job. Taylor said she thinks Ofc Dornay moved his own dog to a relative's house to avoid conflict between the dogs.

215595861,"The UPS trucks always blatantly park in the bike lane or the crosswalk. They have no regard for other road users, needlessly creating an unsafe situation for vulnerable road users such as cyclists or people using the crosswalk.

This happens EVERY WEEK. The drivers are INTENTIONALLY parking in the bike lane knowing they have ample room to properly park next to the curb out of traffic.

I have called the number to report this as it happens but I have been placed on hold for 10+ minutes or on the occasion I speak to the operator they have not dispatched a traffic enforcement officer in a timely manner.

I signed off on their bond release a while back after the general contractor, among other things, restored that portion of the right of way as grass (as called out on the plan set) instead of the mulch it was originally left as. I called Chris, and he said they did not do any work after I advised for bond release. Please re-assign this back to District Inspections. I advise that Mila contact the property owner(s) and instruct they apply for necessary permits to remove the concrete, crushed rock pavers from City right of way, restoring it to grass, and inform them if the ADA ramp/landing are damaged they will need to apply for a UMP/SIP Lite to repair them. You could probably require they get the property surveyed if they ask how much needs to be removed. -- VT ----- 06/15/2021: Per Milagros Cobian - Contacted property owner she is willing to remove the concrete extension at the ADA ramp and get the necessary permits to comply.

A tow truck company attempted to tow my car from my driveway. Per the Cities FAQs: http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/MaintenanceProgram/GreenLake/2019_0723_GLP_PreCon_FAQs_Final.pdf, we were told we would be communicated when our driveways were closed. This did not occur. I also never received any door to door out reach per the FAQs. My family ran out of house at 7:15 AM when we were getting the kids ready to go to school. To all our suprise, our car was about to be towed from our driveway.

I’ve noticed fencing for this same purpose installed all throughout Seattle and think that this area is deserving of some attention. As soon as one person is moved another moves in.

There are numerous RVs and abandoned cars parked along Sand Point Way NE, on the SDOT side of the cyclone fence. Numerous issues have come up, making us stewards (and park visitors) uncomfortable. 
-We've had to pick up human and dog waste on parkland.
-Small fires are built along the fence.
-Usual access to the park via Sand Point Way has been blocked by debris.
-We are beginning to work with High School students from the Waldorf High School, renting building space from the park only a few hundred feet away. 
-One dog commonly poops in the park meadows on parkland. One dog attached a leashed dog belonging to a park users a few weeks ago. Both of us stewards have been approached by a growling, off-leash dog when doing our work. 
-Cyclone fence, which separates parkland from Sand Point Way and had a small dent previously, has been torn down and opened up since this encampment.

This is the current state of the above neighborhood park as of today 4/23. Can you please send a crew to clean up and move these people out?

215501427," last night around 11:25pm i returned home to find two men with their items in my yard standing with their back to the main street despite city light fixing the light nearby. i honked, told them to get out of my yard, then pulled into the driveway. i got out of my car and told them to move. they were confrontational. when i said was going to call the police, they packed up their items but left some even though i told them to take their trash. i took a bad photo of them. about ten minutes later, i went back out to make sure all the trash and men were gone and found a needle sticking in my dirt with a flashlight and a popsicle stick and some other trash. i called the police to find that, despite being by a children's bus stop, i was supposed to use the 'find it fix it app' to dispose of the needle. this is outrageous because it is unsafe. the only good thing is that the police can't tell me i haven't seen any weird men doing weird things to my yard/property, that i should take anti-anxiety medication like they are doctors, and that i should go inside and go to bed. the bad thing is that the homeless can do whatever they want and we have to put up with it because the city refuses to move them and regulate their illegal/unsafe behavior.

191312285,"Customer said debris includes plastic, pipes, fill dirt and debris is in the right of way. There is a large amount of construction debris on the parking strip/sidewalk area in front of my property at 1919 SW Webster and 1927 SW Webster street.  I estimate it is in excess of 10 cubic yards and was left there after the construction of the homes at 1913 and 1911 SW Webster street in late 2016.  Initially it was a humongous pille that went from behind the mailboxes to just past where the steps up to my gate are, blocking access to my front yard.  Blake Lanz, the developer for the two new houses, originally told me he would be removing the pile when they started construction on the lot at 1927 SW Webster around April (2017).  That didn’t happen.  I had health problems in Spring 2017 and was unable to find time to deal with the debris problem until I contacted him in October 2017.  He came out quickly and may have removed some of the debris, but it appears that he mostly moved it to the west side of the area in front of my property and onto the hill in front of the property he owns (1927 SW Webster St).  He moved some of the large boulders in the rockeries and totally regraded both areas. He covered the areas with hay and also put in some crushed aggregate along the road and up towards my gate.When he radically regraded the parking strip in front of my property he covered up the water meter that feeds my house.  That was in late October.  It’s still covered.  I had a utility locate done and attempted to locate it with a shovel.  It did not provide exact location so I was unable to find it in the large area/volume that it may have been in.  I also had a private locate done but they were unable to locate it.I contacted Seattle Public Utilities and they referred me to the correct department in their company and told me about reporting illegal debris. I assume at some point they will come and dig out my meter.  I don’t have a reference number I can supply but if you need one I can call them.  That way any work on the debris can be coordinated between all agencies involved.  Please contact me if you need additional information.",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

213991379," Darren called the Customer Service Bureau upset about the outcome after he filed a claim for damages against the City of Seattle. Darren stated he worked with a claim adjuster Gary Hopkins as well as the claims manager Rick Eilman to reconsider the offer after filing the claim. Darren said he purchased new tires in March 2019. After that, he drove over a pothole that caused damage to the tires and rims and filed a claim against the City. Darren worked with Gary and provided photos of the pothole, the receipt of the new tires and documentation from the tire shop stating if the rims can be repaired or need to be replaced. The tire shop decided after inspection it would cost more to repair the rims than to replace them. Darren said the offer received from the claim adjuster is based on the usage of the tires since the damage and until present. Darren said the offer should not reflect the time after the damage. Darren said he only drove 5000 miles with the new tires during the three months before the damage. Darren wants a response from the director of the Risk Management office.

This encampment has popped up in the Wolf Creek Ravine Natural Area, under the McGraw St. Bridge (east end) in Queen Anne. As mentioned, there are health and safety issues as trash and human refuse collects.  This is attracting rats and other dangerous animals.  The encampment is in a residential area where numerous young children live, play, and go to school. Also, there is a trail that acts as an entrance to the encampment, which leads directly to the route that the neighborhood kids use to walk to and from school. The encampment is located in an ecologically sensitive watershed that is important to the local ecosystem.  We'd like to request that this camp is moved and cleaned up as soon as possible due to the health, safety, and ecological issues it presents to the residents of the neighborhood. There has been an increase in criminal activity in the neighborhood (break-ins, car thefts, etc.).

There also have recently been several reported police incidents on this encampment concerning gunfire and possession of firearms and drugs.

The whole south end of the park with the road closure is full of tents and broken down cars and RVs. The sound from the generators ruins the peaceful atmosphere of the park. In the past month the number of tents has at least tripled. These parks are paid for by tax dollars for EVERYONE to enjoy. It is not a right of anyone to camp wherever they please. Please do something about this. It is not safe, it's getting worse, and it seems as if our government and law enforcement could care less.  I would love to know where I can learn more about what is being done to clean up the tents taking over the city.  Thank you, Erica",SPD-Parking Enforcement,4,1,SEA-Unauthorized Encampment

Hjarta sits on Market Street between 7-11 on 17th NW and Urbana on 15th NW. I have attached a spreadsheet that our HOA President has been compiling of the activity in our west garage. I've also attached a picture that shows some of the activity. In this picture the man in the blue shirt is the one that started the fire. Please let me know if you have any questions.  As I mentioned our garage doors are at the bottom of the ramps so this becomes an ideal place for the homeless to gather and do drugs, use as a bathroom etc. We are putting a second set of doors at the sidewalk level but because of the fabrication process, they most likely won't be installed until the end of summer.  Thank you for your concern and I'm hopeful that the new city administration will be successful in returning Seattle to the beautiful city it is.

Sadly, there are two dead full-grown raccoons that were struck by cars out front of 3721 38th Ave South. They have been moved to the grass, just out of the roadway, so that cars don't continue running over their carcasses. I know you have a ton of dogs to rescue in hot cars today, but we're really hoping that these raccoons can be removed as soon as humanly possible, given the heat and sun exposure.

I have done all that I can to make myself visible to the drivers (blinking lights, reflective apparel, headlamp and waving at them), but continue to find that most drivers either don't see or bother to stop for pedestrians at this cross walk.

Customer said he was again almost hit head on today because of the congestion caused by ambulances parking at the NE corner of Terry Ave and Union St.  Customer said Kindred Care Center has a drop off location drivers do not use because it is ""too small"" for the vehicles. Customer said the facility should be required to fix the drop off area.

This Inquiry has been responded to Rachel. I responded and forwarded the inquiry to Tony Chang PE PM for the project, and David Allen with out reach.

Sidewalk Enforcement Speicalist"") Regarding SDOT Service Request Confirmation - SDOT-21-00216085, Dated October 7th, 2021, no response was ever received.  SDOT added curb ramps on all four corners of the intersection, and new open soil replacing concrete parking strips but didn't hydroseed the bare soil.  I requested SDOT to hydroseed the bare soil, although now there are just two bare corners.  At this point, it's late to hydroseed and we on our NE corner, United Church, will likely ""upgrade"" to eco- and bee-friendly plants in the spring.  I just want to close this out, and not find SDOT hydroseeding over plants in the spring should they ever actually respond.  I know, we are all busy people here.  Thanks for listening.

Campers at the top of the park who have taken over the arbor continue to have illegal fires which pour smoke into the surrounding apartments including mine. Campers also chop wood late at night and early in the morning waking me and other residents of the surrounding apartments. I guess we're at the point where fresh air and peaceful sleep are a privilege around this park. I do really find it concerning how the city continues to allow small numbers of people to deprive many of basic needs. Outside of moving which is not something that can be done spur-of-the moment, the last resort we well-meaning residents have at this point is to continue to report it via this interface. At some point something has to happen, no? Is there a timeline? Can we expect it to be swept once a year? July 6th was the last time and at this point it seems like that would be an optimistic assumption. If we believe that parks are an important part of the urban infrastructure for the reason that they provide a natural setting for those living in a densely-populated part of the city to find respite, then why are you all continuing to do nothing over months?

My neighbor located across the easement from me is a renter and their landlord parks their car in the garage. As a result the renter has decided to park their car in front of the garage in the easement. This prevents me from utilizing or accessing my garage unless I ask the neighbor to move their car. I spoke to someone who is the head of title operations for the company I used and they informed me that SHORT PLAT 20051117900031, which references my townhouse and the easement and is in my title, deems the ""driveway"" an easement. It states that it is not part of any of the townhome properties and should be kept clear at all times. It should only be used for access to the townhomes, walking, or designated parking. Later in the short plat it states that all designated parking is provided within the townhome. I have discussed this information with both the landlord who owns the neighboring townhouse and the renter who lives there. At this point it seems unlikely that they will move their car - they do not believe the information I have sent them from my title.

This needs to be addressed immediately. It's crowded and unsafe and needs to be cleared out. Those people need to be put in shelters. The city needs to use stadiums and football fields if necessary. The city needs to make sure that the homeless practice social distancing as much as possible.I suspect that some of the people crowded into this area at the wall of death are drug users or mentally ill and this is an unsafe living situation for them.

He said that on Friday, 2/19, starting at 8am the entire neighborhood was scheduled for a power shut off  due to pole replacement.  He said a notice placed on doorknob stated the power would be out for 6 hours starting at 8am.  He planned his day around the shut off.  When the shut off  did not start at 8am he said he called City Light at 684-3000 around 8:30am.  The operators there were not very helpful, he said, they told him this was construction and he was given two other numbers to call.  He said those numbers were message lines only. He said after much arduous searching of the City website he finally found someone at City Light who clarified the situation and knew that this planned outage had been Canceled and the neighborhood should have been notified.  This employee was very helpful and told Mr. Tufel that the cancellation was known of, and he has tried to get the system corrected (SCL employee Titus Butcher).  A bit later that day, Mr. Tufel said, someone came by and put something on his door, with no knock, nothing, and those papers said shut off cancelled - reschedule TBD,  and had ""to help you to prepare"" information,  and contact information for Mr. Butcher in bold print, none of which was given with the first SCL communication.

232569169," To whom it may concern, My name is Sandra Green single mother Seattle citizen. I'm sending this email because I'm currently dealing with unemployment for a second time verification process. I've sent them the information needed but it's still been 6 weeks. I was receiving unemployment up until September 2020 that's when I stopped claiming unemployment as I was now getting  workers compensation. My workers compensation ended February 9th and that is when I started claiming unemployment again but instead of it being approved as nothing has changed but the workers comp starting and ending they have not approved it yet and I'm still waiting. A single mother with no income who's healing from a shoulder surgery I had in September. They are pending on missing job information which they have its all the same as before. Last year when I first applied. It should  be a quick easy fix but they are saying it takes up to 12 weeks for someone to even look at it. That's a long time to be with no income with a child in elementary school. I'm not sure what else to do or this well even help me get the process done faster but there had to be some kind of quicker solution for this. Thank you for your time and representation of our state.

She would like the city to provide more phone numbers at the department for information and she suggested giving more ""nitty gritty"" information instead of requiring classes.  She would like ""human contacts"" instead of emails.",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

210444988," Residential disturbance. In this particular incident, drawer+door slamming, item dropping, and stomping began around 11PM the night before, 05/31.These neighbors have been a constant issue with their noise. Often times they are drunk, screaming, slamming, throwing, etc. They also have a dog which barks nonstop all day, and often times have a young child which is screaming all night long that they do nothing about.They are older, in their 50's and 60's. I have tried to discuss their noise levels with them at least three times, and have notified my apartment management at least a dozen times.

240071497," Customer called very frustrated with SPU. She said for five years she has been dealing with SPU Solid Waste Inspections regarding can placement on her street, Clise Pl W. She lives in a condo development where her front door faces Clise Pl W. The units across from hers have front doors facing 32nd Ave W but the garages face Clise Pl W. Those other units have been allowed to place their garbage, recycling and yard waste on Clise Pl W, not on 32nd Ave W. She said she has communicated with Manager Sally Hulsman, Deputy Director Jeff Fowler, and former GM Mami Hari regarding this issue. She reported in July 2016, the solid waste inspector determined can placement should be on 32nd Ave W, however, she said Sally reversed that decision as several property owners were not happy with the original decision. She stated SPU is not following or enforcing SMC 21.36.080a1-Placement of containers. She said the decision to allow all cans to be placed on Clise Ave W is unjustified and irrational. She has emailed her Councilmember and the Mayor's office who in turn have sent her complaints directly to SPU. She said SPU is not doing their job and she has requested new Interim GM, Andrew Lee, respond to her repeated complaints in writing, not Jeff or Sally. Customer was also going to call the Hearing Examiners office for advice.",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

The curb is constantly littered with garbage and rotting food, and always smells of human excrement. On multiple occasions I've noticed exposed needles and cracked glass/bottles as well. The occupants of these tents quite often seem high on drugs and occasionally scream/talk loudly. Recently, friends/acquaintances of these occupants have been congregating around the tents, many a times blocking the curb completely.My request is for the city to restore this block and provide appropriate help for the occupants of the tents.

227156346," There is a large encampment that includes Olga Park, and the median of Ravenna Boulevard from 15th Avenue NE to 17th Avenue NE. There are copious amounts of trash in the park itself, oftentimes spilling into the bike lane on Ravenna Boulevard. There are no trash cans for the encampment in Olga Park to use, only a compost bin that is not big enough for the entire encampment. Additionally, there is often yelling and conflict stemming from the people living in the encampment, that often happens in the middle of the night, interrupting the sleep of everyone in the neighborhood. My neighborhood has also seen an increase in car break-ins since the arrival of the encampment. Just recently, my car was broken into and we found mail that belonged to a resident living within a block of the encampment. Furthermore, there are no places for any of the encampment's residents to go to the bathroom, leading me to believe that they must be going in and around the encampment, and in areas nearby such as Cowen park, neighbor's yards, and who knows where else. In the midst of a pandemic, this is an incredible hazard being posed to the area these people are illegally camping in. Additionally, the encampments between 15th and 17th Avenues have repeatedly been leaving uncovered needles on the grass in the median of Ravenna Boulevard. Leaving used needles where children used to play is unacceptable, and those responsible should be forced to leave.",CSB-General Inquiry,7,1,SEA-Unauthorized Encampment

237794248," An individual has been camping at this site for several months now. His aggressive behavior has recently escalated. I've witnessed him walking around his tent carrying a large knife while talking angrily to himself. He has electrical power (batteries?) and while he has always played very loud music in the middle of the night, in the last few days he has played loud music while yelling at the top of his lungs: ""I want all Americans to die, die, die, die, I want all Americans to die"" and ""Fuck Americans, fuck you, I want you all to die"". This went on for about 45 minutes from 4 a.m. to about 4:45 a.m. this morning. Several months ago, he pounded loudly on our door in the middle of the night yelling ""help me, help me"" over and over again. This went on for about 30 minutes. The next morning, he told our neighbor that two of his friends were trying to kill him. Our front porch was covered in pepper spray residue. We called the police both this morning and at the time of the earlier incident. This morning, I was told by the officer that responded that he is very familiar with the individual camping at this spot (he said his name is Peter Vinzi). It's exceptionally disconcerting to witness this escalation of violent behavior in recent weeks. For all intents and purposes, an area that was used by many for lunches and play (of course, like all Seattle neighborhoods, there are many small children on our street who routinely use Cowen Park) has now become Peter's private property and he is regularly disturbing the neighborhood with routine outbreaks in the middle of the night of extremely loud, profane, and abusive hollering that goes on for extended periods of time.",CSB-General Inquiry,7,1,SEA-Unauthorized Encampment

235054157," Seattle City Light was conducting scheduled work in the alley outside we use to access our house (and garage) on 5/23/21 (work order #:1909169-17, Crew 351-2F Rodney Dunlap, Jr).  The work order stated that work would be running from 8am-6pm. When we left the house at 9:30pm, we were unable to leave due to a linesman bucket truck (71636D) blocking our single access alley, despite it being 3.5 hours after the scheduled end time. At no point in the work order letter indicating that the work was happening was there notice that we would be blocked in our alley, unable to leave. While the construction crew did eventually move the truck, it took 25 minutes and we ended up being late for something very important. There are 12 houses who can only access their garages/entrances through they alley off of Andover between 21st and 20th streets.

Oil slicks on the street every 50 feet or so.  I believe this is from the recycle pick up. They need to fix their truck because it's hard to even walk my dog down the street there's oil all over.

This is in regards to your four parking complaints that were submitted on Saturday, October 2nd.  When you need an immediate response for a blocked driveway or vehicles parked too long in a load zone, please call the non-emergency number.  Find It Fix It and the Customer Service Response system through the Customer Service Bureau that you used do not go into the SPD Dispatch Center, nor are they monitored by human eyes in real time.  Parking Enforcement matters are downloaded Monday through Friday.  As a result, we did not receive your parking complaints until Monday morning.  A parking enforcement officer did go to the location on Monday and your business driveway was clear and all the load zones on the block were empty.  The non-emergency number is (206) 625- 5011; choose option 6 for faster service.  SPD Dispatch will send one of the on-duty parking enforcement officers to the location.  This is the fastest response to any parking complaint, day or evening that we can offer.  On weekends and during the evening hours our ranks are thin, but we have officers in the field Monday through Saturday from 6am until 11pm to answer these radio calls.  Parking Enforcement does not work on Sundays, but sworn officers will respond if they have time.

Thank you,
Melanie Sellars

This week an encampment moved the Port of Seattle's fence on SDOT's property, which had been erected to protect the next phase of work we're doing this summer, in order to set up a camp. Our youth, who had a cleanup/design input event planned for this Saturday, are incredible advocates for public access to greenspace in the Duwamish Valley. We would encourage the City to address this particular encampment so we and the many agency partners involved can continue our work this summer. Through neighborhood outreach, our unhoused neighbors in the encampment have agreed to move this weekend, however, 2 RVs need towing assistance.

However the city continues to increase my taxes to combat homelessness. But the resources seem to only be applied to building expensive fencing near businesses. This problem used to be contained until that fencing was put up. Now we have an encampment 50 yards off my front porch and near 200 additional homes where we regularly have package thefts and car prowls. My neighbors have also reported this same encampment.

232099519," Hello,For the past four weeks, I have been volunteering to book Covid vaccine appointments for those at greatest risk and need.  I have booked appointments for more than 100 seniors and childcare workers - work that has been time consuming but incredibly rewarding.  After spending countless hours working on behalf of people I  have never met, I am extremely sad and disappointed as I start hearing an increasing number of stories of people lying their way through the registration process to book appointments because they see so many openings (e.g., at Lumen Field) that they think ""won't possibly get filled.""  So, I have two questions/comments on this...1) I sincerely hope that despite the scale of the Lumen site, that some effort is being made to check eligibility.  I know it is supposed to be an ""honor system,"" but with so many people desperate for vaccines, an honor system just doesn't always work.  It seems the only way to cut down on abuse is to catch people who are doing things they should not be doing.2) At what point will the city forego the step of adding oneself to the ""notification list"" and just allow people to register?  Once people have the link to register, they can share it freely.  There is nothing in the email that indicates it should not be shared, so it is not necessarily shared with malicious intent.  But by adding the step of a waitlist, it adds an extra burden to those with limited time and limited access.  A bus driver or grocery store clerk might have time early in the morning or late at night to add themselves to the waitlist (and could register right then if they had the link), but by the time they receive the registration link hours later, appointments could have been filled by people who have received the registration link through other means - either knowingly or unknowingly taking a shortcut.I applaud the city's efforts to think about equity ... the West Seattle and Rainier sites have helped.  But, without further attention and thought, the Lumen site has the potential to become a place where people can easily abuse the system and those of greatest need get shut out of the process because of limited resources.Sincerely,Lynne Salkin Morris",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

Filling the location with garbage, food waste, and encroaching on the narrow access in that location. This might present an ADA compliance issue with how narrow the passable area is.There are people there writhing on the ground and mumbling. Several of the homeless are regularly there and seem to be suffering from a severe mental crisis and are in need of help.The first and last place you see in Seattle by water is a urine soaked and garbage laden tunnel, pressed by those who are unwell and occasionally aggressive, lashing out at those walking by or each other.This isn't all homeless or even all homeless by the ferry docks or the walkway; but that section of bridge is a marring mark on an otherwise succeeding city. This is a shame to the people who are living there in crisis and a restriction of passage for those who work and live in Seattle. Commutes that start or end in puddles of food waste and urine are a shame to the city.Has there been outreach attempts with the people sleeping and living there? What solutions can be expected, both for the people sleeping there, and for reclaiming public infrastructure with the primary purpose of transportation.   Thank you for time and effort. I understand your ability to answer my questions and request might be limited. I just wish to impress that something needs to be done for the sake of all stakeholders in the Seattle community. Ditto with the overlap of potential issues between SDOT and WSDOT property. Please do your best with this request, then forward this Request to the council offices of Sally Bagshaw (Disctrict 7), and Teresa Mosqueda (at-large), and  M. Lorena González (at-large).

228477437," Seattle Parks is not being honest and transparent about parks. For example: All of the pictures for this park do NOT show any tents or garbage.I drove by there a few days ago and there were many, many tents throughout the park, along with various types of garbage.My issue is false presentation.The Parks Dept should either:a. clean up the parks to look like the picturesorb. show pictures of actual conditions.Accordingly, the text description should also be updated. For example:Current text:. . . .Come and relax while your little ones enjoy the accessible sandbox, slide and whirl. An open plaza with multiple benches is a great place to read your library books you just checked out. . . . If I was a parent I would not feel comfortable taking my child to that park. Shouldn't there be warnings that people are living in the park? Or that there might be discarded needles (which I've personally seen in parks) and that everyone should never go barefoot.There is no mention in the description that free camping without permit is allowed. The Parks Dept should -- as a part of transparency and honesty with the taxpayers -- do either a or b above. Bruce Miller",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

I read the RRIO requirements and understand that I would need to

into a rental property. I also understand that there are additional
requirements for short-term rentals.  However, I am not clear 
about the definition of “one rental housing unit” and whether one
single home – registered as one rental housing unit – could be
rented to more than one renter at the same time for rental periods
of between 1 and several months. Would you please define what
constitutes “one rental housing unit” and whether the
aforementioned proposed use of one housing unit would 
violate any Seattle City rules and regulation.

He would like SCL to respond with reasons why the bill was so high, or if this was possibly a mistake? He does not believe the excessive power was used inside the home.

This isn't a challenging problem to solve and SDOT should be able to create a rapid and effective solution to it. 02/15/2022:  Per Brandon Billak - Forwarded back to DOT Roads to be reassigned to other division/team.  This is not active construction (nothing for the Street Use Operations inspector to enforce) and not encroaching the Right-Of-Way (nothing for the Public Space Management inspector to enforce).  --  VT,CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

Carl said he was told by Harbor Patrol that they are aware of the disabled boat and are waiting for directive from the MO regarding the next steps.

Since these campers have been parked, unsanitary conditions have been created by human waste, there have been numerous fires, and we believe at least one bullet hole in the window of Friends of the Children.  Further, you may have seen the KOMO story this morning about the Walgreens being intentionally crashed into in order to steal the ATM.

238615702," 3rd Avenue - I just returned from a holiday weekend in your great city, having stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Pioneer Square.  Although I’ve been to Seattle many times in the past, I was nonetheless shocked and disheartened by the transformation of a major tourist destination into a homeless encampment with its devastating impact on the local economy.  No, I was not tipsy when I walked to the hotel from the LINK station, but rather zigzagging to avoid certain people and other obstacles.    But the ambience of Pioneer Square felt rather reassuring compared to what I experienced later while waiting for a bus on the west side of 3rd Avenue between Union and Pike Streets.   While there were no tents, the block was infested with persons living in doorways and in front of abandoned storefronts exhibiting gross anti-social and probably illegal behavior.    Despite the rampant drug use and confrontational behavior of the individuals “living” on this block, Seattle Police were nowhere in sight.   Just around the corner in a triangle park there was a well dressed gentleman in a kiosk dispensing brochures about improving the business district in downtown Seattle.  Handing out leaflets while turning a blind eye to what’s happening on 3rd Avenue isn’t going to revitalize downtown, in my humble opinion.  In fact, if Seattle is simply going to cede the city to these unfortunate people, I might not be back.",CSB-General Inquiry,7,1,SEA-Unauthorized Encampment

208842898,"The most recent tent that showed up is now using public trees to hang his/her tents I'm specifically looking to get more information on the existing encampment on Mary Ave NW and 83rd St in Ballard, Seattle - right next to the Safeway and across the street from my home. I’m reaching out to you to get help to understand when this particular area will be addressed given the continuous expansion of the encampment and the danger that comes with it. This particular encampment as grown as much as 6x in the last two months, going from a single tent to as much as 6 on a single street. The people within the tents are continually disturbing the piece by yelling profanities at each other, passing out on the sidewalks, and leaving their garbage and belongings everywhere. One tent in particular even started on fire and started a car parked on Mary Ave on fire, closing down the entire street for over 3 hours, preventing people access to their homes. Thankfully no one was hurt. I’ve contacted authorities when these issues occur; however, they have not solved the route of the problem which is removing the tents and their occupants altogether. I’ve called the city 10+ times to report the growing encampment and also reached out to the Ballard Alliance group to express concerns. It’s my understanding that they’ve allocated ~$128,000 to help the City of Seattle improve the Public Safety/Public Health, specifically noting that these dollars would be going to work with SPD, the City’s Navigation Team and key city leaders to address illegal camping and RV dwellings.

 

I, along with numerous of the other families in the area, have small children that we enjoy walking with around the beautiful neighborhood. Since this encampment has grown, I no longer feel comfortable doing so and have contemplated moving from the area altogether. I no longer feel safe walking across Mary Ave to get to the newly renovated Safeway grocery store and I am most of the time blocked due to garbage and tents from walking on the sidewalk to get to the Walgreens and restaurants across the street. I fear letting my daughter walk on the sidewalks outside our home or allowing her to run around in Baker Park due to the used needles that have been discarded by the occupants of the encampment.

 

I look forward to hearing your response on when this area will be prioritized by your team and what further action the city is taking to ensure encampments in residential neighborhoods are prevented.

Additionally, there is overgrown vegetation on their planting strip which is growing into and over the sidewalk.  Anytime there is rain or snow, it’s impossible to use that portion of the sidewalk because it become a marsh due to the overgrown vegetation on their planting strip.

Hello,

What does it mean when a submission/new request is labeled as ""closed?"" I do not see any follow up as to what was done, what ""closed"" means and if the issue was resolved or not.

I put in a request for an abandoned vehicle and it is listed as ""closed"" but the car is still there.and collecting more trash around it, spilling onto the parking strip and into the street. So, I pit in a new request for the same vehicle.

Hoping for some help.

Thank you in advance.

Best,

The building was destroyed and he is starting to rebuild the townhomes.  He expressed deep concerns about the possibility of more fires happening and suspects it is related to the encampment behind the property at Lewis park. He said there has been encampments there before but is finding flammable items thrown from the park bridge down onto his property.  He reported construction tools being stolen, portable toilet that was locked was broken into and hand soap stolen. He said he put up a fence to restrict access but campers can still throw garbage and other items down onto his property. Neighbors also have had problems with packages stolen and have called police with no response.

Not long after our neighbor's dogs became ill our dog wound up in the hospital with similar symptoms. Our vet inquired if it was possible she got into anything toxic, which we couldn't confirm, but noted out neighbor's dogs had similar symptoms. We called the front office of West Ridge Park Apartments to notify them of the paint in the grass on around 9/21/18 when our dog became sick. We were told it would be cleaned up asap and they apologized for the inconvenience. On 9/26/18 I noticed the paint was still there and called again.

Is this legal? He most certainly does not live on this block. He seems to be using our block as a parking lot for his work truck and car.

Customer said the work was done many years ago and she called SPU to request a permanent repair of the street and sidewalk. SPU could not find anything in their records at that address. SPU sent someone to meet with the customer and inspect the area. After inspection SPU employee told the customer she should request SDOT to repair the street.

Yesterday I got a $40 parking ticket because there was a long line at the store and I was parked 15 minutes past the time I paid for on the meter.This guy has been parked in front of our house for MONTHS. It's a residential street and the new girls academy is being built across the street. There appears to be OPEN drug dealing going in at all hours of the day and night. And of course we have to watch out for needles, condoms and excrement whenever we attempt to walk down the street with our dog and young children.The traffic circle in front of our house is constantly full of crap (literally). We do our best to clear it unless there are biological or hazardous waste, in which case we use the Find It Fix It app.The infuriating thing is that one block north of us is all light industrial and commercial buildings (close to Burger King), and there are plenty of available spots over there. But he prefers to park on OUR residential because, as he once said to me when I asked, ""he doesn't feel safe around those crazies!"" Really?? And how do you think we feel having you taking up the entire block of our public street and carrying on yoir business (literally and metaphorically) in broad daylight?THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I have called repeatedly -- the police, the City navigation team, Find It Fix It -- over the years and yet nothing is done about it. I will hold the City responsible for any harm that comes to me or my family; unfortunately a massive class action lawsuit seems to be the only thing that might get the City's attention.This needs to stop before citizens start taking the law into their own hands. We're not going to sit around like sitting ducks and let ourselves and our families be predated upon continually, with the City's express blessing. Whether it's the rapes, open drug dealing danger of a child or pet stepping on an infected needles. We don't feel safe in our own home. We need help and we need it NOW!!!

He states he has been dealing with SPU Solid Waste to resolve this issue for a year and this is still on-going.  He says if it is not resolved this week he will seek legal action.  He says he has been dealing with Sally Hulsman and Mai Huong Kim and has sent SPU video evidence of the occurrences.  They say 1) there is nothing to be done, or 2) they will fine WM.  Most recently they said they were escalating this issue to SDCI.  Mr. Bolt says he has a contact at SDCI who said that is not true, SDCI can do nothing here.  He said he sent an email to Sally and Mai yesterday asking who is your Supervisor, and who are you discussing this with at SDCI, but has received no response.  He said, either the WM fines are not enough, or nothing is really being done after a whole year of complaints.  The location is the whole block of N 90th St. between Midvale and Nesbit - all the way to Aurora. The residential pick up is Thursday morning, the neighboring apartment building pick up is Tuesday and the Taco Bell is yet another day.

202776840," Issue: ILLEGAL CAMPING & crimeLocation: Along the banks of ship canal between 1st NW & 3rd NW (btwn 142 NW Canal & 309 NW 39th St). So, this is not a complaint against the businesses, just using the address. Request: REMOVE encampment, RV's. If they don't want help, escort them out of city limits. Problems: A large permanent encampment has been there for SEVERAL YEARS now. If you bike or walk by, you may not see them. We can see them from work across the canal (we work at King Co. Environmental Lab), or anyone could that travels on the canal. We have also seen loads of bicycles being delivered. These are NOT from jobs as bike messengers, but likely stolen.Along the path have found needles and most disturbingly human waste. It's ironic that Seattle PUD & King Co. spend millions on bacterial monitoring in storm water; storm water upgrades; stream restoration; etc. yet allow areas where human waste is out in the open. I feel sorry for homeless and volunteer in services that help them, but these are permanent camps and folks refuse help or to move on. As homeowner resident, I would be fined if violated waste rules (in fact, last week it cost me at least $40 to dump an old toilet that Ballard Reuse wouldn't take), didn't pay my phone/water/sewer/electric bill, dumped my old paint down the drain, etc. I dispose of pet waste into the garbage, plant/food waste into compost bin. Also, it's dangerous to the campers. A couple years ago, a disturbed man was piling crates and wood along the banks, at times chest deep in the water, and no one came to help after I called police and DES.

224782738," Here is a brief, short summary about my living situation. I live in an apartment in South Seattle that is located in Rainier Valley which is close to Rainier Beach. I have lived in an apartment for 3 1/2 years, almost 4. My neighbors who live above me and who has lived in the same apartment building as me have lived here the longest. My neighbors have been very rude, disruptive, disrespectful, disgusting and a coward towards me including my family for as long as I can remember. My neighbors have also been making a lot of loud, unnecessary noises, my neighbors have been up all night drinking while arguing extremely loud every night including partying, my neighbors have been banging through the walls nonstop as well as jumping up and down against the hardwood floor no matter what, moving their furniture that sounds like nails scratching on a hard chalkboard, and etc. At first, they were always being quiet at home, everything was running smoothly and me and my family didn't had any problems with them at all until things started to go left. My neighbors started to do whatever they want, when they want and for as long as they want disruptively nonstop every day and night. My neighbors didn't care who they were bothering and who had to say something about what they were doing that was getting on their nerves. Not only are they being loud and disruptive every night but every morning, afternoon and evening as well. Me and my Mom have confronted them multiple times to stop the noise level and to be quiet so that we don't have to hear them being loud through the walls and when we're doing something but they won't listen. Also, my Mom had to tell my landlord owner to tell my neighbors to not be disruptive multiple times as well but they didn't obey nor followed his rules and continued to do whatever they want when they want. Most of my old, fellow neighbors had confronted them multiple times about the noise level that they were making and what not but they still wouldn't listen which is why most of them moved out since they couldn't handle dealing with living in the same apartment as them while they were being extremely loud any longer. I don't know what their problem is but me and my family has had enough of them. My neighbors are so rude that one time when me and my brother were doing our online classes during the pandemic outbreak, my neighbors were jumping up and down while throwing heavy objects against the hardwood floor while yelling at each other so loud that even my Mom started to complain about their noise level. My neighbors heard what she had to say through the wall. At first, they were laughing and making fun of us because they thought that it was funny to hear her frustrating when they could care less about my Mom but they took the noise to the next level, that's when things got ugly. I've tried to get back at them by making louder noises then them. The only reason why I did that was to get them to stop which usually helps but this time, it didn't helped at all. They ended up going outside and one of them who is a female named Lisa stuck the middle finger at my Mom and her Mom stuck her tongue at my Mom thinking that they can get away with it. I have tried to call the cops but with no success at all. I didn't know who else to call to try to solve the situation with my neighbors when that incident happened that day which is why I was highly upset including my Mom. Everything became worse when my neighbors started to harass me online through social media called Snapchat to talk crap about me online only because they felt some way of way about me when I have called them out multiple times not to be disruptive. Not only that but they have been making fun of me 24/7 through the walls and what not just to get their revenge. I know that I have filed a similar complaint a couple of times already and you will probably see this again but I just desperately need your help since I canno",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

207960566," Honorable Mayor Durkan,I live in the downtown Ballard area. For weeks (months ???) I’ve witnessed a couple of tents at 5423 Shilshoe NW which have been stockpiling bikes. I’ve observed bike forks and other parts laid out (for sale?) and there seems to always be someone who is “working” on a bike.Around the tents there is garbage. As a senior female citizen, I would not walk past the tents. However there are no sidewalks on the west side of Shilshoe Ave NW. I generally pass these tents on my bicycle.I have several concerns about these tents, bikes and homeless campers. First, the waste being generated is a public health issue for them and nearby residents. Second, I suspect the bikes may be stolen property if serial numbers were checked with bikes listed as stolen on bikeindex.org.My third concern is fire. Across the street from these tents is Magnum Storage. It is a very large wooden building filled with flammable items. I think of the huge fire caused by arson at Gascoigne Lumber which destroyed that business. I wouldn’t want to see Magnum Storage meet the same fate.Please have the police or Navigation team check on these campers and the bicycles which are piling up.Thank you,Nancy Kuta",CSB-General Inquiry,7,1,SEA-Unauthorized Encampment

Thank you so much!I have previously reported a one-tent encampment across the road from my driveway (4517 Ravenna Ave. NE), just a bit south of Ravenna Woods. Will/could this be part of the Tuesday clean-up?And is it possible to do ANYTHING to make Ravenna Woods less desirable as an encampment base? The last two times it was cleared, the campers started returning and settling in again within 48 hours.

Seattle Parks and Recreation has no lighting installation project planned at Martha Washington.  Our staff recall that City Light staff would be working with the Friends of Martha Washington Park community group to explore the feasibility of lighting options  but were unable to verify which City Light staff.  I ve forwarded your inquiry to the City s Customer Service Bureau for them to assign to City Light  so please expect to hear from staff at City Light.  Again  my apologies for the long delay.  Sincerely  Laurie Dunlap Superintendent s Office  Seattle Parks and Recreation   cid image003.png@01D5568F.0E2D4EA0    Laurie Dunlap Superintendent s Office City of Seattle  Seattle Parks and Recreation Lighting installation at Martha Washington Park    Hello-  I Attended a meeting at Martha Washington Park last summer with Seattle Parks Department  Seattle police department in response to the lethal shooting of Ryan De La Cruz.

We visit this park almost daily year round.

I doing so, they left a pile of soft asphalt in the handicapped ramp on the NW corner of Meridian Ave N. This morning, a seriously disabled person in wheel chair became stuck in the soft asphalt. It took considerable time, a number of good Samaritans, and considerable distress to the disabled person to extricate her from the soft asphalt. Her wheel chair is now covered in asphalt, as are the shoes, clothes and feet of the persons assisting her.Please identify the construction company responsible for this asphalt and take appropriate action. This must be a violation of rules and regulations, and an unacceptable construction practice. I believe some sort of punishment is appropriate. Also, the asphalt needs to be cleaned up immediately. Persons walking will get asphalt on their shoes and the handicap ramp is unusable by handicapped persons. We should not have a repeat of this morning's incident.

As I'm sure you're aware, music venues were one of the hardest hit businesses due to the pandemic. As we have recently opened our door again we realized not only are we having the grueling task of re-building our business but also dealing with an issue which is beyond our control and we are desperately asking for the city's assistance with this issue. This issue is the dangerous homeless encampments/ RVs directly outside our place of business. Within the last month alone we have dealt with harassment, attempted arson (gasoline thrown on our building), drug dealing, drug paraphernalia (needles) thrown on our property, weapons, theft of our customers property, attempted burglary and all round unsanitary hygiene of the area. We are a female led business with mainly female staff and the daily intimidation which is thrust upon us is becoming too dangerous for us to ensure our safety. Within the next week we will be starting music events which will bring 500+ members of public to our establishment daily and we are in fear of ours and their safety. Our closing time will go back to the pre-pandemic 2am and for our customers to be leaving our establishment straight into an already dangerous situation is scary for us.  We are calling upon the help of our city officials to keep the public safe and help an already struggling business in dire straits. I have attached photos of the area directly outside our business, we ask for all these illegal dwelling/ abandoned vehicles  to be removed ASAP before any serious life threatening situations happen. Our surrounding locally owned businesses are suffering too and they can provide details of their encounters. I have details of what has happened in the last month alone and can provide further details.  Regards, Larissa Steward Substation",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

Last call was made last weekend to both city offices, yet no action to address our concerns.  There is an older tan van with Oregon license plates that is camping overnight on the waterfront of Lincoln Park and it has been 4 weeks or more of illegal camping. No action has resulted in other cars parking overnight with people sleeping in vehicles.  It is in direct view and park users must walk by the vehicles early in the morning not knowing who is in the vehicles.  Safety is of concern on park property, as well as non-action by Lincoln Park, city of Seattle staff so far to address this.  The pool is open early and many teens walking by.  Park staff have acknowledged they are aware of the vehicle when spoken directly to, and have indicated they mentioned to their supervisor.  Yet no action taken to address.  Very disappointed in no response and will address through other means, including our elected representatives, if not resolved since this poses a safety issue.  Cannot believe that the park staff are present in the morning and aware of this and do not go down to address when they start at 6am.  I have been down along the park at this time, and seen them address trash and avoid addressing these vehicles.

204963497," Good morning, Ms. Durkan, Well, I had hoped the momentum that was happening last August would continue through the winter, but, unfortunately, it appears to have slowed down in a major way, at least in North Ballard. Two recent developments in the Loyal Heights/Crown Hill neighborhood: 1) We now have a homeless camp taking shape on the parking strip IN FRONT OF MY DAUGHTER'S PRESCHOOL at the corner of 85th and 14th Ave NW. Every parent in the school, along with the school's owner and teachers, have been calling the city and the police on a daily basis in hopes that something will be done, but nothing has happened. In fact, each day we drop off our kids, a new tent is there. How do we go about getting this resolved? 2) There were squatters that broke in to the vacant house in the middle of our street (20th Ave NW in between 80th and 77th) and took up residence. Besides kicking in two doors there, they made off with a new washer and dryer (which was also caught on a neighbors video camera), assorted other items, and even cut some electrical wiring (presumably to sell the copper?). The police were called when we saw people leaving the house, but by the time they arrived the people had left. Then, the owner came by the next day and found someone sleeping in the house. He noted that the back fence and back door were kicked in. The police were called again this time and they found the people a short distance up our alley. They were handcuffed and then let go because the police flat out said ""There is nothing we can do. Thank the city council."" Obviously, this is extremely troubling for all of us neighbors who live on 20th and go to work EVERYDAY so that we can pay exorbitant taxes to a city that appears to be doing NOTHING to address the homeless situation. We have had to take the matter in our own hands and rally together because we can't count on our city leaders to address this situation. This has been going on for far too long. Allowing people to break the law by camping on and stealing/destroying both city and personal property is unacceptable. My patience and compassion has run out, we need to take more serious action to address the homeless situation in our city.

Orion stated Lincoln Towing was willing to work with him after the second call. Lincoln Towing told Orion the vehicle was impounded by SPD due to parking over 72 hours without moving the vehicle. SPD told Orion that Lincoln towing made a mistake in their process and informed him late about the towing. Lincoln Towing told Orion that SPD should have notified him about the impound. Orion stated that is not correct wants to file a claim for damages against the City of Seattle due to improper towing.

191317011,"Picture attached This is a potential City liability problem.A home inspector was at our house this summer to advise us on items that may need repair or upgrading over the next five years. While doing so, he found that our gutter downspout adjoining our back deck was “hot,” as in carrying current. The source? The power line to our house from the City I was/is touching our gutter.Over summer and fall we made several calls to the City Light to report the problem. At one point they promised to send someone out to look or at least take pictures. We simply suggested that the power line either be lowered a bit or encased in non conducting material. Nothing happened.Now it is winter and rainy. We’d like to check/clean our gutters and I’d like to cut back some vegetation. My wife won’t let me do it, and I’m not about to hire a gutter cleaner when there is a potential risk of electrocution. And, if something were to happen, it isn’t particularly comforting to think that the “deep pocket” City will be left holding the bag.Perhaps you can persuade City Light to be responsive and fix the problem.Thanks,Steve Brown",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

PEO Mulder sent this response to the complainant: Thanks for using the Customer Service Response (CSR) system. We received your complaint about vehicles regularly parking to close or into your driveway. I did send a parking enforcement officer out this morning to check 1606 NW 83 St.   

The city does not go out and paint curbs for residential driveways. However, you are allowed to paint them yourself.  

Here are the SDOT guidelines.

 This is a Vespa type scooter with no front wheel. At 9:30AM on Thur 1/11/2018 this had been dumped in the Fred Meyer parking lot across from their main entrance. I saw it there while shopping that morning. It was partly on a wooden dolly in their parking lot and was along the boat yard fence. There were no cars or vehicles around the scooter. By Fri morning on 1/12/2018 the scooter had been moved to Pono Ranch and was now on 46th street in the Seattle public right of way. It's evident that Fred Meyer moved it over to Pono Ranch and illegally dumped it into the City right of way. It did not see or observe them doing this, but it is clear that is what happened.  It would be correct if Fred Meyer was possibly cited for this illegal dumping. It is not right of them to be dumping items from their parking lot to other people's property.

But when I came upon the scene, I didn't know what to make of it. There was a tent right in the middle of a 3-way intersection. Not on a planting strip... literally in the street. ** This alone is bad enough and wrong. Camping in the middle of the street? The potential for harm to both the campers as well as vehicle occupants is enough to compel any sane city to get this site cleared ASAP. Your policies, though, have allowed this to happen. Then I noticed that there was this guy next to a stolen shopping cart loaded with stuff who was waving makeshift flaming torches around. In the street. This scared me quite a bit, but I wondered if I should bother calling 911, because our police are stretched far too thin and I wasn't confident they'd be allowed to do anything about it. ** Nobody should have to face this kind of unnecessary danger in our city. Not me, not other citizens, not visitors. Your policies, though, have allowed this to happen. Thankfully, I did decide to call 911. While I was on the phone, he proceeded to light the contents of his shopping cart on fire and roll the cart towards Market Street. Just imagine if I'd chosen not to call and he'd rolled that flaming shopping cart into the middle of the busiest street in Ballard? ** This guy was clearly not well, he should not be left alone to suffer on the street, he should be compelled someplace where he can be safe and he can't harm others.

242140396," I'm subject to harassment by my neighbors. I've called non-emergency, but they aren't taking calls right now. I had 2 handicap parking spaces permitted in front of my home many years ago (Parking permit expires in 2025, placard #1: 430780Z, placard #2: 430781Z, ID DPID0403772). I used the northern most spot, and my late husband used the other space before he passed away this year. Now there's an Acura (plate #BNP0055) parking where I consider my space to be (due to vandalism on my vehicle, that's the only location close enough to be captured on my Ring door monitor system.) I don't believe the disabled placard permit he uses is registered to him, but I've asked him politely if I could park in my preferred space and he yelled at me swearing. This morning (12/20/21) there were several vehicles revving their motors on the street in what I consider an attempt to harass and intimidate me. I think the matters are related. I live alone and am scared to be here. I need that space in order to be safe and transport groceries and other items to my home.

I would just simply like to pass on my complete and utter disappointment for the lack of respect for the gentleman who simply ask for the councils undivided attention and then not given a restart of his two minutes. First and foremost   how can you all expect to do your jobs if you cannot give the average citizen the respect and attention they deserve and secondly how can you all expect to be voted for when LISTENING is a very vital part of your jobs. The lack of professionalism is profound and undeserving of any person and I am extremely disappointed that nobody had the means of standing up for this man and giving him the respect he deserves. For example   a council men states   Thank you   next  without fully addressing the citizens concern . The 2 min rule is not law and a restart would have done no damage and to say so is to excuse the councils behavior which is unacceptable. And if you all are being biased and allowing other citizens to speak for a longer term without interruption and with full attention you should all be ashamed of yourselves and do not deserve your jobs. That is all. Also thousands of people are expecting a public statement apology in regards to yesterday s incident.   Very sincerely  A concerned citizen.,CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

This is in regards to your four parking complaints that were submitted on Saturday, October 2nd.  When you need an immediate response for a blocked driveway or vehicles parked too long in a load zone, please call the non-emergency number.  Find It Fix It and the Customer Service Response system through the Customer Service Bureau that you used do not go into the SPD Dispatch Center, nor are they monitored by human eyes in real time.  Parking Enforcement matters are downloaded Monday through Friday.  As a result, we did not receive your parking complaints until Monday morning.  A parking enforcement officer did go to the location on Monday and your business driveway was clear and all the load zones on the block were empty.  The non-emergency number is (206) 625- 5011; choose option 6 for faster service.  SPD Dispatch will send one of the on-duty parking enforcement officers to the location.  This is the fastest response to any parking complaint, day or evening that we can offer.  On weekends and during the evening hours our ranks are thin, but we have officers in the field Monday through Saturday from 6am until 11pm to answer these radio calls.  Parking Enforcement does not work on Sundays, but sworn officers will respond if they have time.

Thank you,
Melanie Sellars

I highly support use of the park by the public and have assisted with the clean up of Piper's Orchard, and clean up of the area adjacent to my properties along with selling a green belt property to the parks dept. and even offer the public using these areas if I can even collect and dispose of their garbage or other wastes. I am just concerned that we work with the parks and city to keep the use of this area for all visitors and our native wildlife. Vacant tent and garbage accumulating above the Piper Orchard. Tent was set up but no one is using it and it has now fallen down and becoming unusable. This has become an attractive nuisance and a temporary hang out and garbage is piling up. It is on Park property and thus no one should camp or live here, nor be on site after posted hours. I fear that as the weather improves this will be used for drug use, temporary habitation and the tent is an invitation to use this area in an illegal way. It is not easily viewed from the orchard and so invites clandestine usage. Can I as an adjacent landowner remove this tent and garbage? I would be glad to assist or allow access through my property to eradicate this nuisance and invitation to future illegal usage.

I am writing to file a complaint regarding a homeless encampment located on Harvard Ave. between Spring St. and Broadway in Capitol Hill. It has been growing over the last several months, and it has become a major public health concern. There is open drug use, fighting, trash, human waste, and rat infestation, among other things. It is also a congregate setting, which is a major concern with the current pandemic and Delta varian outbreak. It has now been several months, and instead of it being handled, it is growing larger by the day. I’m not sure why nothing has been done at this point, but it is located on city property (the area between the street and sidewalk),and also encroaches on the sidewalk. There is also a health clinic (Polyclinic) located directly next to this encampment, which furthers my public health concern. I am sure there are individuals visiting the clinic with compromised immune systems. I live in the building directly next to this encampment, located at 1425 Spring St. (The Danforth). 

Please let me know what can be done, and if you need further information or pictures. I appreciate your attention regarding this matter.

231268511,"SPD-Sent to OPA as well. Yesterday I had a rather unpleasant encounter with SPD Press Dept Detective Carson.  I am unable to find a direct email for her, but am hoping maybe someone who cares will see this here.     As a private citizen I can't get through endless voice mail loops that no one responds to.  I leave voice mails that no one responds to.  I have contacted the FBI and I can tell you the person detailed on the attachment is not on their list and no one local is publicizing the image.   I can't get anyone to listen to me, but I expect TMZ will be happy to get the scoop.  I'm trying to give SPD/City of Seattle a heads up.  __     I am very disappointed in our phone encounter yesterday (February 4), at roughly 9:00 AM.     I started out by saying ""I am aware of jurisdictional issues, but I'm reaching out to you as the press department because maybe you can connect me with someone who can help.""     At that point you began talking over me and demanding that I respect your authority to tell me about those very jurisdictional issues I already acknowledged. You could have, perhaps, referred me to internal affairs. You could have done many things. But you refused to do anything but grudgingly give me the 1-800 FBI number that I already told you I had already contacted.     I'm sorry your jurisdiction doesn't include America citizen.     Since you were unwilling/refused to give me any other contacts, you might want to take the time to read the attachment that I thought of without you-- maybe Seattle Seahawks and the Seattle Police can join together to ask our public to assist the FBI in their ongoing investigation. But wait -- that might be good press and since maybe you are helping to hide your officers already known to be there, maybe you don't want any press at all.     You might want to do a CYA/forward this email to whoever -- or not. I will be indeed contacting TMZ. I do expect that they will be happy to pursue this story.     Ask yourself, did you pursue or obstruct justice in our encounter? Either way, do you feel good about it or were you just doing your job which apparently is to shout over someone trying to catch a terrorist?",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

231809720," Dear Ms. Durkan I would like to inform you about manipulations performed by Seattle city parking enforcement or else other organisations involved in this ridiculous case. I have recently lost my long term employment with the Boeing company and after several months of unemployment found a job at a great local Seattle company called ""Charlie's Produce"". The company is located at the address 4103 2nd Ave South in Seattle. Since it is heavy industrial zoning, the Company evaluated employee parking options nearby depending on city's ordinance and distributed maps to us. Please see Charlies produce map attached. Most of the parking available was along the 1st Ave South staring from South Dakota Street and moving couple of blocks North on 1st Ave.  I started to park there on 1/11/2021 coming to work at around 6am. I noticed a tall pole near where I parked with RED sign stating ""park South of here"". Ok. I did so. For about two months. Today on March 5th, 2021 I came to my car after parking as usual on the same spot for 2 months and I noticed a parking ticket on my windshield. I was cited for parking in restricted zone. I looked at the same pole and noticed that all of a sudden the sign was no longer RED but Black stating a total opposite of what it was few days ago  ""No parking South of here"". I first thought it's a joke. Who would without notification to local business which significantly contributes to the welfare of not only Seattle but entire state of Washington change the sign to the opposite. Why?  What is the reason?  I went to Parking sign patterns on Seattle.gov site and none of them were presented in black and nine looked like the one on the pole  who puts the signs there and who controls their authentic approved appearance. All restrictive parking signs were posted in RED ink as examples. Who can see BLACK signs in the dark at 6am in March especially if you know few days ago it was RED, yet non restrictive. Who is doing this kind of stuff? It is outrageous!!! If you want to collect your profits at the expense of hard working people that need to park during their work you must be ashamed of yourself. Please, if you can, investigate this issue and explain why this is happening. I included patterns of restrictive parking signs from city website. It feels that this sign is placed there illegally. I added picture of the sign on the pole as well. SincerelyJulia TerrySenior Food Safety CoordinatorCharlie's Produce",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

They claim that the nearest location is the most reasonable solution.  The current set-out locations on Clise Pl. W. for 2201, 2203 and 2205 32nd Ave. W. residents’ solid waste containers is unfair to Clise Pl. W. residents because there are suitable set-out locations on 32nd Ave. W. and because the 2-day inconvenience to Clise Pl. W. residents is far greater than the extra few minutes inconvenience to 32nd Ave. W. residents if they were to place their containers on their street.   They are not answering several of my questions (1).  The fact that Jeff Fowler can’t provide rational and explicit answers to several of my questions speaks for itself.

232127162," Hi.  I hate to bother you with this. Generally speaking, how can one pay more taxes to the City of Seattle than what they owe? I've recently run into news stories about tech workers in Seattle who want to pay more taxes, but they just can't seem to figure out how to do it under existing laws.  So, I thought I'd ask.  Last week's Stranger weekly had one such story.     I just want to be able to offer viable suggestions to these folks.  First thought was to pay Use Tax whether it was owed or not.  Part would go to the state and part would go to the local tax code (if applicable).  Not the most efficient way to pay taxes just to Seattle, though.    Second thought was that it can't be too uncommon for a wealthy individual to leave real estate or something of value to the city.  So how could a tech worker just gift money to the City of Seattle?Third, was to have them increase the taxable assessed values of their homes so they pay more property taxes.  I've heard of folks contesting property assessments to lower taxable values, but is it possible to have the value increased?Generally, how could someone who wants to pay extra taxes properly remit funds to the City?  Thank you for your time and help. Tim Harbert206-370-0432",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

224733803," Yesterday morning my husband and I were walking through Volunteer Park, and were surprised to hear loud music coming from the pavilion. We went to see what was going on and it was a gathering of people watching/listening to music. As we walked by, we realized it was a religious gathering. No one wore masks. This morning I saw in my “Nextdoor” feed, many people heard this and saw it, and all, like us were annoyed that this could take place especially with the obvious disregard for COVID safety policies. One person discovered that it was an Evangelical Church from Snohomish. From the complaints, it went all day - morning to evening. I live in Capitol Hill and fortunately after walking a couple of blocks out of the Park the sound diminished.  The fact that a religious group met all day in the park, that many people use dalily and made it basically unusable is not OK.  Can the City please do something to stop this from happening again. Maybe write a letter to the church? Thanks.",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry

PEO Mulder sent this response to the complainant: Thank you for using the Customer Request System. I sent a parking enforcement officer to check on the vehicles parking on the planting strip at 1841 Harvard Ave. I did notice by looking at the pictures, at least one of the vehicles has a disabled placard.  It is indeed illegal to park on a planting strip (whether paved or grass) with one exception: those vehicles displaying a valid disabled plate, placard or tab may do so. We can cite the vehicles not displaying a valid placard.

Here is the ordinance:
11.72.320 Planting strip.
No person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle on a planting strip unless the vehicle bears a special placard or license plate issued under RCW Chapter 46.19.

I am a business owner with an office in Pioneer Square. I understand the greater issues at play but it time to do something about the health crisis that is the rampant homeless camps in the city. 

I'm getting ready to open our office again a couple days a week and the Pergola homeless camp is a deterrent for my staff since we all look right at it. Any idea who can I contact with the city? 

It is time to move these folks along as things open back up for the good of businesses in Pioneer Square. I think they should all be offered transitional options that enable them to keep their lifestyle but if they don't accept this option it is time to go. It is a blight on this city.

Jamie was told by the arborist it is not SCL responsibility and she will have to hire someone else to trim the trees. The arborist stated SCL will help with disconnecting the power lines when the trees will be trimmed. Jamie expressed to the arborist she does not think it is her responsibility since the trees are encroaching into the power lines and are located across from her house in the planting strip. She also expressed her concerns about the hanging broken branches from the trees and over the sidewalk. Jamie said the arborist was extremely condescending and rude, told her it is not SCL problem and referred her to SDOT. Jamie told him she already contacted SDOT and they referred her to SCL.

The same is true of our neighbor immediately to the north.  We both have painted yellow on the curb to no avail.  After calling parking enforcement today, we were told that the city could put a no parking sign up; I have attached a picture, which shows our driveways and a car parked at the return of mine.  The lines we have painted are two or three feet, less than the five foot limit but still enough to make clear that no car can legally park between our driveways.  Is there any way that you can help and implement the officer's idea to put up a sign?  The yellow paint has not worked.  Thanks so much!

236164211," URGENT: Homeless/ RV ISSUE - 645 NW 45t - TRYING THIS EMAIL AGAIN TO REACH MORE AWARENESS OF THE DANGER TO THE PUBLIC/ OUR FEMALE LED BUSINESS AND GAIN HELP WITH OUR MUSIC VENUE THAT SURVIVED A PANDEMIC ONLY TO BE THRUST INTO AN ISSUE THAT THE CITY IS NOT HELPING US WITH!To whom it may concern, I am contacting you on behalf of Substation, a music venue which has recently reopened after the pandemic. As I'm sure you're aware, music venues were one of the hardest hit businesses due to the pandemic. As we have recently opened our door again we realized not only are we having the grueling task of re-building our business but also dealing with an issue which is beyond our control and we are desperately asking for the city's assistance with this issue. This issue is the dangerous homeless encampments/ RVs directly outside our place of business. Within the last month alone we have dealt with harassment, attempted arson (gasoline thrown on our building), drug dealing, drug paraphernalia (needles) thrown on our property, weapons, theft of our customers property, attempted burglary and all round unsanitary hygiene of the area. We are a female led business with mainly female staff and the daily intimidation which is thrust upon us is becoming too dangerous for us to ensure our safety. Within the next week we will be starting music events which will bring 500+ members of public to our establishment daily and we are in fear of ours and their safety. Our closing time will go back to the pre-pandemic 2am and for our customers to be leaving our establishment straight into an already dangerous situation is scary for us.  We are calling upon the help of our city officials to keep the public safe and help an already struggling business in dire straits. I have attached photos of the area directly outside our business, we ask for all these illegal dwelling/ abandoned vehicles  to be removed ASAP before any serious life threatening situations happen. Our surrounding locally owned businesses are suffering too and they can provide details of their encounters. I have details of what has happened in the last month alone and can provide further details.  Regards, Larissa Steward Substation",SPD-Parking Enforcement,4,7,CSB-General Inquiry

If he wanted to run away he has had most of his life to do that. Before I knew it, he had become a teenager. And at the most vonarable time of both of our lives, he cought a butt wippin. He did not run away after that. The ved depart that I have not seen says that he's fine after that. Never the less, John's next conscience decision, was to immediately buy another collar. I have not hit him since becouse my imediate intention was to never have this happen again naturally. Though the decision to remove my therapy dog has caused more harm that it has helped.

Property has a hedge at the corner of W Blaine St and 8th Ave W that is totally overgrown, over the strip of land that is owned by the city or parks department. This creates a severe safety hazard. This is a blind corner. Nowadays, with many people walking on the street keeping safe distances, it is very dangerous to walk or bike along this side of the street, and walking along the other side is impossible due safe distance requirements. This hedge should be cut back about 10 ft to provide safe passage at this corner.",CSB-General Inquiry,7,12,SEA-Overgrown Vegetation

Today we had to wait two lights to get a clear intersection to WALK. 
The left turn light onto Aurora South needs to be removed or reset. It was never intended to accommodate traffic detoured to 80th when 85th was resurfaced. The result is grid lock. Stone is blocked. The crosswalk has cars stopped across the entire intersection in grid lock. Greenlake Way N has cars in gridlock. I can't leave my driveway. I can't get out because the traffic blocks it for blocks hours at a time. It's unsafe.
