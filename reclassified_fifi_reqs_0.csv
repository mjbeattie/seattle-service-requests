205933365," Dear Mayor Durkan, I have worked in the old Cress building at Third and Pike before the new QFC moved in and now I travel through the neighborhood on my way for volunteer work at the Aquarium and my frequent trips to the Market. It has always been a ""tough"" intersection but now I find myself avoiding it entirely because of the filth that has accumulated on the sidewalks in resent weeks and over the last couple of months it seems. I realize that it is an important intersection for the homeless as there is the QFC and Starbucks and transit available there. The checkers in the QFC told me the cleaning of the sidewalk is not their problem as there is supposed to be street cleaners in that neighborhood. The recent cold weather has made this an incredibly unpleasant area. I feel that this area needs immediate attention. I cannot blame the homeless but something has to be done to keep this area clean. I am sure it is attracting rats and further filth. Can the City provide more cleaners in this area, or provide garbage bags and pickup for the ""residence"" to self clean and then provide some guidance to them to help, and make contact with the store owners to provide some effort to keep this area clean. It seems to me the stores, the GFC and Starbucks, and the restaurants on Pike, are deliberately not cleaning in the hopes that the filth will drive away the street people. That doesn't work. It is a downright eyesore and does not look good to the residence of the neighborhood or to the tourists going to the Market. What can I do to help.",CSB-General Inquiry,7,7,CSB-General Inquiry
