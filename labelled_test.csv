250992139," Request for ONE WAY/DO NOT ENTER Traffic/Road Signage. 13th Ave S is home to several townhomes and apartment complexes with families and street parking. Many people enter 13th Ave S from the entrance of Beacon Ave S, only to use is as a shortcut. Many cars often far exceed the speed limit when driving onto this road and there have been many near miss collisions due to high speed commuters. This should be a private road, as it is only used for access up to Beacon Ave S for the residents on 13th Ave S. 13th Ave S should be a ONE WAY or have a DO NOT ENTER sign facing Beacon Ave S to deter high speed commuters. This would allow for 13th Ave S residents to be protected from people using this road as a speed ramp or shortcut. In addition to this, new town homes are currently in construction at the top of 13th Ave S at the corner of Beacon Ave S. These town homes will cause a large displacement of the current parking situation for residents on 13th Ave S. City Planning should have been able to predict this, but 13th Ave S is will not have enough parking for it's residents once this new townhome is built. There is no additional parking provided to this structure and therefore, a ONE WAY or DO NOT ENTER sign will deter the future residents from parking on an already over populated, narrow, and unsafe street among all the commuters that choose to use it as a shortcut. Our neighborhood is already grossly overpopulated via parking due to the close proximity to the nearest light rail station. Current residents, like myself, WILL BE DISPLACED and will be unable to park at their residences as they have already been for the past few years. Additionally, as traffic increases to the area with the natural increase of population as well as the specific population increase with new townhomes previously mentioned, there is a higher risk for more and more accidents as residents and commuters alike use the road.",CSB-General Inquiry,7

He stated he has repeatedly reported car campers parking in his lot or surrounding his business (recent report #22-00165654). He said parking enforcement comes out and tags the vehicles but the occupants remove the notice and nothing happens. He reported 3-4 RV campers in their parking lot. SPD has been called and has responded to crime occurring (theft, drug activity) but recommended he and his staff not approach car campers for safety reasons. Customer reported last week police arrested one female occupant in a stolen vehicle. He also reported speaking with a female parking enforcement officer who was less than helpful and informed him that ""was not her job"" when he was asking about car camping. Customer expressed his frustration with enforcement of parking violations and SPD's lack of resources for responding to non-urgent calls. Customer said a lot of his customers are older clients and they no longer feel safe coming to their store because they have to park near car campers and have witnessed criminal activity.

252691736," I am writing with concerns about the RV's, boats and trash on 26th and 29th and Brandon in West Seattle, adjacent to the south entrance of Camp Long and some tralis along Longfellow Creek.   Is there a plan to clean this area up? It is full of trash, vehicles that don't run, and we feel unsafe to use the trails. Last night there was a reported gunshot.   I've lived here for one year, and had $3K in bikes stolen, as well as a break-in to our locked shed in our backyard. Prior to us moving in, just over one year ago, there were no RV's parked in those areas, and no incidents in this home with theft for at least 12 years. This is not a coincidence.  There are also plenty of needles in an alley around the corner from our home, as well as other issues. My kids are not safe walking to their friends' houses or the library that are nearby. I should not have to drive them to those close locations.

This person refuses to accept a referral to shelter and insists on returning to a particular location no matter what he is told.   We are talking about a person known as ""Smiley"".

He camps on Western Ave between Yesler and Columbia and refuses to accept a referral to shelter and always returns to this location.  He harasses passersby, especially women and children.
On one occasion he started to go after a little girl that was running ahead of her parents.  Her father had to cut him off so that he wouldn't harm her.

Other times he menaces young women by invading their personal space and impeding their activities.  He yells and screams and threatens anyone who requests him to leave.   An off-duty police officer had to mace him the other day.  He harasses my wife whenever she goes near him.

He is a known sexual predator.  He is getting messier and bolder because he thinks he owns this neighborhood.   He attracts other campers so that after a while an encampment springs up.

We know this because last year he was the first person to set up his tent that became a large encampment with six tents and one van.  They had fires and drug deals and stolen bike sales at the time.  They fought with each other day and night.  They used our property as a toilet and caused a huge mess.  So now it is starting again with another tent that has already joined him.  We notice more noise which keeps us awake at night. This person needs mental health attention and he needs to be prevented from disturbing the lives of residents.   We don't want this person or any tent encampments on our street.   They leave human waste and trash and drug paraphenalia all around.   He is ruining our life.

253200213," Councilwoman Herbold,  I am writing to seek your help in arresting the decline of two parks in West Seattle. One is Constellation, a very popular shore on a local access only road. Recently, it has been invaded by homeless who are living in cars or on the beach. Yesterday, somebody arrived by a stolen boat identified by the Harbor Police.   One ""camper"" has occupied a driftwood teepee that has been a popular play area for local children. As you well know, that alone causes a significant safety issue for the children.   Me-Kwa-Mooks has long been a problem with multiple long-term homeless vehicles. Now there is a school bus with a sign saying ""Smile You're on Camera"" in the window. This implies that a homeless person is filming children at what should be a safe space.  SPD and the Parks Department regularly service these areas. I think it would be an easy task to remind these vehicles to move during regular patrols. Or at least ticket the vehicles properly as the law requires.  This issue is not due to a housing shortage. These are law breakers setting up housing at the most picturesque parks in Seattle -- ones that are to be used safely by all residents. We need your help in fixing this problem.   Personally, I am willing to assist you in any way possible with this issue. Please contact me to discuss that further and to share your thoughts.

253468442," Thursday afternoon on 8/18/22, I noticed a strange smell in my apartment. I wasn’t sure what it was but it smelled like something was hot or burning. Being in my apartment with the smell was making me queasy and I didn’t feel comfortable being in my apartment. I asked someone from the maintenance staff of my apartment to come check it out for me. He determined it was coming from the building just north of my apartment building. He informed the people in that building what was happening and they did something to stop the source of the smell from continuing. But the smell still lingered in my apartment and I didn’t know if it was safe for me to be in my apartment so I called the Fire Department. The firemen determined that the smell wasn’t a fire risk. The firemen and I went next door to speak with the people in the building next door and I believe they said they had been using a laser cutter on some vinyl or foam and that that’s probably what I was smelling. (I might not have the technical details totally correct but that’s what I remember being said.) I was able to use an air mover to get the smell out of my apartment so I could go to sleep in my apartment fairly comfortably that night. I woke up the next day feeling fine.This was a very unsettling experience. I didn’t feel comfortable in my own living space and was worried I might have to find somewhere else to spend the night. I didn’t know (and still don’t know) if it was unsafe for me to be in my apartment when the source of the smell was present. And I certainly wouldn’t feel comfortable inviting anyone else into my home if the smell was present. I would like to know what exactly was happening next door that was causing the smell, why it was happening, and I would most of all like assurance that it won’t happen again. I would also like to know that whatever I was already exposed to that was making me feel sick hasn’t already caused some harm to my health and that the source of the smell isn’t somehow still lingering in my apartment (although my apartment smells fine now).

255231218," Hello dear Seattle Road & Sidewalk care Person,  I'm writing to report a problem that's making a sidewalk impassable. It's one I use every week, hauling my groceries in a small cart, and the result is that I'm having to go around the obstacle by traveling into a lane with cars coming from behind me. As winter is coming and it's getting dark, this is just too dangerous.  Where: Lakeview Boulevard East, just south of Boylston St, on the east side of Lakeview.  Obstacle: Someone is living in a camper van on the edge of the road, below what I think may be the St Mark's Greenbelt. They have filled the sidewalk adjacent to the vehicle with their equipment and belongings.   Impact: There really isn't room to pass, especially since I'm pulling my groceries. No wheelchair or stroller could pass. And even if I had no cart, I wouldn't want to pass through what someone is using as a private space (it's intimidating). I have no problem with an unsheltered person living as best they can, but I do mind that I can't use the sidewalk beside their vehicle, because it pushes me around their van into the street, into traffic I can't see because we are both northbound. (I don't want to use the west side of Lakeview because there is a freeway offramp a bit further north on that side that is difficult to cross as a pedestrian.)  Dear Person, I would appreciate it so much if you could let me know whether you, or another City office, can help. The van-dweller just needs to respect the needs of pedestrians, being careful not to store anything on the sidewalk. Is there someone who can talk with them? I'm not able to do it myself.

The large tree has lifted the sidewalk in several places and is also impacting the owner's garage structure (see google maps images). In addition, she now has a possible leak on her private property that she believes is due to the tree. She notified SPU and a meter inspection was done but they did not find any leaks. She confirmed her water bill has been high for 3 years, but she has no other evidence of a leak occurring. She had one plumber inspect her line recently and was told the meter was still running even though the water wasn't on at the time.

Left turn light not changing on MLK at Othello. The light to go straight has been green, but the left turn light has only been green once for a short time. The lane hasn?t cleared in 10 minutes. I realize the light cycle needs to accommodate trains, but waiting five cycles to make a turn seems like too much. This is the northbound side waiting to turn west on Othello.

251262942,"Transferred to East PEO Supervisor Asuncion Our neighbors who live at 2218 E. McGraw st. 98112 use their own guest pass to park for weeks in front of our home and I purchased a guest pass for my visitors and they cannot find a place to park because this same neighbor owns 4 vehicles. The white “ Rivian” truck has their own pass on it right now, the truck has a paper license – 002497A12 and is currently parked in front of our home. It would be good to see them get a ticket because they have their own driveway and think that parking 4 vehicles on McGraw st. is some how fair. We always have to park in our driveway even though we have an rpz sticker on our car, this neighbor is hogging the spaces and using their own guest pass and I want it to stop.

This has been a consistent problem for those of us living closest to the private club. Please contact the club and plead our case. Their parking lot has many spaces available, yet club members insist on parking in No Parking areas (and our lawns). Nearly all of us have experienced personal property damage as a result. Multiple communications have been attempted with their Board of Directors which go ignored. Please help us enforce community co-operation and courtesy from these people. Currently (and daily) there are about 6 cars parked in a No Parking Area off of 31st Ave just east of the tennis courts on the grassy area many of us walk our children and pts on. When blocked by cars on this sidewalk area we are forced to walk in the street. Many of their members are teenage drivers who speed and are careless and dangerous drivers making street walking unsafe for us and our families. ",SPD-Parking Enforcement,4

252264628,"I put a request in with Parks to re- stripe and sign the lot.
 On 07/24/22 my family paid for a day permit to launch our boat at Stan Sayers boat launch. The first thing we noticed is parking is limited and 2 of the trailers were taking up 2 parking spaces. There are also broken trailers parked on the grass and in other parking spaces. When we attempted to trailer our boat in the evening, the park was so full of people and cars, the only space allowed left for a boat ramp was blocked by a car and we were not able to remove our boat from the water. After we got the attention of the car blocking the ramp, the parking spots, including the trailer spots were filled with 2-3 cars in some spaces making maneuvering though the parking lot with a trailer extremely difficult and dangerous. Our truck was damaged in the process of attempting to to make a tight turn with limited space. We have been using this boat launch for over 10 years and each year the maintenance of the park and the law enforcement has deteriorated. The open use of marijuana  and alcohol  in the park is so out of control we wont be taking our kids back there. We paid $12 for a day permit and I'm not sure if everyone using the park is paying or who is enforcing it or what the money is being spent on.",SPD-Parking Enforcement,4

252998649,"8/10/2022: Not construction related. Re-assign to Parking Enforcement, per Sam Garcia.  -NA

8-16-22  Refer this to SDOT Street Use Inspectors.  per George Murray. A truck trailer from ABF (U-Pack Moving) was placed on the street in front of my house on Friday, August 5, 2022, approximately 8:30-9:30 a.m. I was not home to see the drop. The trailer extends between 2 driveways & slightly past one of the driveways, with no clearance distance on either side.  The trailer makes driving tenuous on the street, and pulling out of driveways blind.  I don’t think that emergency vehicles or solid waste vehicles could get through.  I have attached photos of the trailer and placement.  No street signage was posted, and we were given no warning or information about the trailer placement in front of our house.  We learned within a few hours and after some phone calls that the trailer would be loaded Saturday morning, after which the neighbors were leaving town.  They said the trailer would be removed sometime Monday.  The neighbors are located directly across the street at 7319 24th Avenue NE (Ravenna).  I appreciate that moving is difficult, and packing modes are difficult in a city. But, I am wondering if there should have been a permit and some signage and notification for neighbors.  I am wondering why an ABF driver would choose to park illegally, impinging driveways.  As of today, Sunday, the trailer is still out front and we are hoping it will be removed tomorrow, but not confident.  I write this complaint so the actions by the owner and ABF are in the record.  If the trailer is not gone on Monday, I will make further contact with the city (Tuesday is solid waste pickup day). I would like to know what are the rules around parking a moving trailer. It is not a POD, nor is it a motor vehicle, though a truck cab will be required to pick up the trailer.  Thank you for you help with this issue.  P.Sullivan, The neighbor across the street",SPD-Parking Enforcement,4

251975519," Hi Margo,   Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.  And thanks for your thoughtful response.    Please appreciate that our neighbors are quite worried about relying exclusively on LPR technology.  Law and parking enforcement are always encouraging citizens to take an active role in keeping our neighborhoods safe and urging scofflaws to adhere to the rules.  LPR takes that out of our hands and illegal parkers know it.  If they only have to keep an eye out for the rare appearance of a parking enforcement officer, they will even take advantage of the system more.  We’ve already seen evidence of this trend in the short time since the system has gone to LPR.    The only way the LPR system will work is if surveillance is increased to every two hours and at least 3-4 evening sweeps to make sure permitted cars have a place to park when arriving home.  My wife works from home, and has since the beginning of the pandemic, and she reports only seeing parking enforcement maybe 2-3 times per week on our stretch of Fariview Ave. and only once during the middle of the day.  The problem is EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS so the absence of a parking permit has NO EFFECT.    We have people living in their cars parking on Fairview.  They get around the rules by moving a few spots down the street every day but they are parked overnight most nights.  Trash, noise, drug paraphernalia, liquor bottles and general public nuisances are DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE LACK OF PARKING ENFORCEMENT around Lake Union.  Citizens who pay nothing are basically given waterfront property and they abuse it to the detriment of the whole neighborhood.  I’m all for supporting the less fortunate, but not if they cause immediate and irreversible damage and make our neighborhood more dangerous.    How do I file a formal complaint with the City?  The lack of action has myself and many of my neighbors very upset.    Thanks, David",SDOT-Abandoned Vehicle,2

Yvette from Seattle Seaplanes called to report recent escalating RV encampment issues that have appeared at her business now that the Terry Pettus Park site was recently cleared. Currently, Yvette describes about a dozen RV's are now parked outside of the business. Drugs, half naked guys wandering around with propane tanks, garbage and a big uptick in criminal activity. A string of employee vehicle break-ins now are occurring and they cannot park nearby the business anymore without further risk. There is a detached trailer is blocking access near the driveway and it has plywood built up all around it. A minivan also is parked awkwardly into the street making navigation treacherous. Due to the safety concerns for her employees, increasing volume of vehicles appearing with the recent site clearing at Terry Pettus Park nearby and rising crime concerns for her employees and her facility, Yvette is requesting these RV's be dispersed.",SDOT-Abandoned Vehicle,2

These cars are part of a larger problem that has developed on this block over the past year where the cars are being stripped and rebuilt in the middle of the night by an assortment of different individuals who openly using narcotics (even in broad daylight next to the new youth center). They are very loud and the people coming to buy drugs or car parts have made this street unsafe. It all centers around a man that moved into the Bravo Apts at 1212 E Remington Court. I do call 911 when I see people using drugs. And I have contacted the property managers (InCity) of the buildings about the tenant, but nothing is being done by anyone.

255297798," Hello dear Seattle Road & Sidewalk care Person,  I'm writing to report a problem that's making a sidewalk impassable. It's one I use every week, hauling my groceries in a small cart, and the result is that I'm having to go around the obstacle by traveling into a lane with cars coming from behind me. As winter is coming and it's getting dark, this is just too dangerous.  Where: Lakeview Boulevard East, just south of Boylston St, on the east side of Lakeview.  Obstacle: Someone is living in a camper van on the edge of the road, below what I think may be the St Mark's Greenbelt. They have filled the sidewalk adjacent to the vehicle with their equipment and belongings.   Impact: There really isn't room to pass, especially since I'm pulling my groceries. No wheelchair or stroller could pass. And even if I had no cart, I wouldn't want to pass through what someone is using as a private space (it's intimidating). I have no problem with an unsheltered person living as best they can, but I do mind that I can't use the sidewalk beside their vehicle, because it pushes me around their van into the street, into traffic I can't see because we are both northbound. (I don't want to use the west side of Lakeview because there is a freeway offramp a bit further north on that side that is difficult to cross as a pedestrian.)  Dear Person, I would appreciate it so much if you could let me know whether you, or another City office, can help. The van-dweller just needs to respect the needs of pedestrians, being careful not to store anything on the sidewalk. Is there someone who can talk with them? I'm not able to do it myself.  Thank you,  Ixtlan-Wales Isischild Eastlake, Seattle",SDOT-Abandoned Vehicle,2

256712318," There is an unpermitted structure currently being expanded both out, and up, on the 5300 block of 14th Avenue S. The attached photos highlight the size and scope of the structure, which spans the street, greenway and sidewalk.   This structure presents a clear and present danger to pedestrians who are forced to walk in the street. Additionally, the structure, which is being built up, does not comply with building codes, so its structural integrity may pose a risk to Cleveland High School students who loiter near the structure during lunch and study breaks. Finally, the structure may inhibit emergency services vehicles from responding, should they need to position ambulances or fire trucks at the end of the street.   The Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections is also aware of this issue, but is unable to address it due to the fact that the structure is built on public land. Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. We look forward to a halt of construction on this property and any measure taken to keep our neighborhood and city safe.

To Whom It May Concern,

I am a homeowner on Lakeview Blvd E in N. Capitol Hill near the Greenbelt and Egan house park. For the last several weeks the park has become an RV camp where several RVs have been camped in violation of parking rules and making the park completely inaccessible and unwelcoming and certainly not what was intended when the park and historical site was created. 

Please address this issue as soon as possible. Please forward this to whomever is responsible for the upkeep of the park.

I'd like to request a response from the city on 2 illegal encampments including illegally parked RVs on Nickerson St. They are within one block of each other. Two RVs and tents are at 192 Nickerson St and 1 RV is at 203 Nickerson St. They have been here for weeks and the Case IDs on the Customer Service portal are piling up. 

Can you please provide a status on when these RVs and illegal encampments will be moved? 

I've put together a list of all the Case IDs for your reference. Please review the attached Excel document. I've also included them below so you can see how long this has been going on and how many folks have submitted a request without any action. These were easy to find by searching ""Nickerson St"" in the Service Portal.

258490515,"Hi  Can you please reply and tell me if you can resolve this issue for us?   4510 Greenwood Ave North - No Parking spot in front of house.  I am listing the case # I received back on Jan 3, 2022 when I first contacted you about this problem on our residential street.   I also phoned your office a couple of times this year and one time spoke to a helpful employee who was going to take action and get the parking patrol there to ticket all the cars.     This happens every day or night - but it is random the times cars are parked there.         I have before taken photos of the cars and their license plates and asked your office if I can send the photos to your office to ticket them or to contact them.    Your office declined to take my photos of the illegal parkers.  Illegal parking - your No Parking sign: Daily, there are cars or car parked across from our condo building directly in front of a spot with a No Parking sign.    This is a traffic hazard and a safety hazard - as well as a traffic slow down.    Essentially any car parked there blocks other cars trying to get by or at a minimum, narrows the street flow to just 1 lane.   Since the No Parking spot is constantly filled with illegal parked cars, you have to wait for the oncoming car to go by, and then go around the illegal car.  Yesterday the City of Seattle was called to this site for a downed tree in the middle of the street.   That tree was yanked down by a Mack truck trying to drive on our narrow street, and had to go around a truck on the other side of the street (by the No Parking sign).      The Mack truck yanked down the bottom half of the tree as it tried to squeeze by and pass.  Since before January 2022, we have tried as neighbors to proactively go out and ask illegal parking drivers to move their car.    I also have left notes on some of the illegal cars asking them to move out of the illegal parking zone.  Nothing works.  Earlier this year when I spoke to your office, the employee was going to get the ticketing people to drive by and ticket cars.   I beleve your parking patrol may have gone by there, but done so rarely that possibly no cars were ticketed or present at that moment.  What is a solution?   Could the City somehow block that illegal spot so cars cannot park there?     Or send an agent to drive by for a full week every hour or two to ticket cars?    We can't predict what time the cars will be parked there - but we see it happen every day.  The neighbors have done all we can do and I am back for a 3rd time to ask your department again to take action to resolve.   It is a safety hazard as well as blocks traffic.   Often it is the same few cars (gray SUVs) that park there, in addition to on going delivery trucks or cars - that block the road there.  Thanks - Joyce R ",SDOT-Abandoned Vehicle,2

258946287,"The huge asphalt patch in the middle of the intersection at N 48th St and Wallingford Ave N is very uneven and is a danger to bicyclists, both due to the uneven pavement as well as extra measures that bicyclists are forced to take to navigate through the patch -- which can cause cars to hit them due to not expecting the bicyclist to slow down. My wife bikes this every day on her commute and has to slow way down to stay safe and not risk falling off her bike. I frequently see other bicyclists pass through this intersection while contending with cars using this street as an arterial to get to N 50th St (and then I-5) or to continue on to Green Lake. I have biked this path as well and agree that it is unsafe. The asphalt patch has sunken well below the surrounding concrete, so there's a jarring drop off for bicyclists and small wheel users (like scooters). I've included some pictures of where it is worst, but the entire asphalt area should be dug up and replaced in the short term, or more properly, a new concrete panel needs to be installed to fix this permanently. As a bicyclist, the rough pavement forces me to slow down to nearly a stop in order to cross this intersection safely, and often drivers on this stretch of road are speeding and impatient to get to N 50th on their way to I-5, which increases the risk of a car-bicyclist collision. Please fix this before a bicyclist gets hurt. Thank you for your help. ",SDOT-Pothole,11

Uplifted road panel on 1st Ave NW Greenway cause of bike crash. This uplift is located at N 83rd St and 1st Ave NE at the roundabout. It is high enough to capture the wheel while negotiating the roundabout. In this case the bike was containing straight through. Between the natural lean of a bike while turning, and the ?captured? wheel, the bottom of the cargo bike slid out and crashed ,seriously injuring its passenger. A greenway is supposed to be safe for bikes to navigate and many family cargo bikes and children use this route to school. Please either grind this hard edge flat or fill the edge with a tar or concrete overlay to flatten the pavement. In dark or wet conditions this is a serious hazard. Not sure how to categorize this? Street maintenance or pothole?

It has recently come to my attention that many of the signs hanging on the Aurora bridge that show the suicide hotline have been covered with grafity. I think that these signs are very important to have visible and was wondering if there was anything you could do to replace or clean them.

 

Thanks for your time,

Graffiti gets replaced soon as it's removed (but they can't write on the tape so maybe parking enforcement stops removing the tape?? I haven't put it up but appreciated whoever did. I sometimes see other random stickers and I guess I get why those get removed but why remove those and then leave the trump graffiti visible for days until it's ""fixed"" only for it to get re-graffitied within 24 hours.)

Some contractor the city hired awhile ago, Mesa? Meza? Did some drilling into Beacon Ave in front of my house to install anodes for the cities water pipelines. I guess as part of their work on the street they installed this mesh leaf catcher thing in the water catch basin on my property. Since then water can?t flow into it because the fools did a half-baked job and left this like you see in the picture.

The improper sloping of the newly cast sidewalk causes rainwater to flow into our property.  This has caused flooded our building 3 times in the past causing tens of thousands of dollars of damage as well as forced us to spend tens of thousands more in storm water drainage systems.  The utility work that was done on our planting strip ?fixed? the sidewalk so water flows down the sidewalk and into our property.  The sidewalk should have been sloped towards the street so water would flow towards the street.

There's trash in the street. Employees sometimes park their cars in the road for hours because they can't fit between all the tents and trash. We've reported on the find it fix it app, and they came and did a clean up. But it doesn't help. They post what days you will get towed because of the clean up. So all the homeless people packed their stuff up and disappeared for a few days. As soon as the clean up project and threat of towing was gone, everything returned. This space is for parking, not living. These trailers need to be towed to a yard. Signs need to go up saying you can't park, and then the rules need to be enforced. Someone should patrol to tow every other week, It is a public health risk, and ESPECIALLY a transportation issue. We will be hiring lots of new employees to keep up with the summer rush, and they too will have to park their cars in the street or in piles of trash and needles.",SEA-Unauthorized Encampment,1

There is rampant drug use, fire setting, yelling and screaming at all hours of the day and night, trash piles accumulating and new tents arriving every day. I don’t understand why I have to be fearful going out of my house that I pay taxes on because the city won’t do anything about letting people live worse than animals.

It was one thing when it was an eyesore, but the threatening behavior towards my staff and customers is completely unacceptable. No one feels safe here. No other block in the area is suffering from this, please do something about it before something worse happens. ",SEA-Unauthorized Encampment,1

There's also lots of bicycles and bicycle parts that show up in piles, then moved away. Needle use in the area. Someone lit trash on fire recently nearby my home.

256665706," There is an unpermitted structure currently being expanded both out, and up, on the 5300 block of 14th Avenue S. The attached photos highlight the size and scope of the structure, which spans the street, greenway and sidewalk.   This structure presents a clear and present danger to pedestrians who are forced to walk in the street. Additionally, the structure, which is being built up, does not comply with building codes, so its structural integrity may pose a risk to Cleveland High School students who loiter near the structure during lunch and study breaks. Finally, the structure may inhibit emergency services vehicles from responding, should they need to position ambulances or fire trucks at the end of the street.   The Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections is also aware of this issue, but is unable to address it due to the fact that the structure is built on public land. Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. We look forward to a halt of construction on this property and any measure taken to keep our neighborhood and city safe.

 5310 14th Ave S a/k/a 5315 14th Ave S * COMPLAINT  (Per SDOT: Hello, please reassign to Homeless Encampment.  Thank you,)Hi SDOT, Today SDCI investigated a complaint of “Unpermitted, continuously expanding structure being built over public green space, street parking and the pedestrian walkway. Structure represents a risk to public safety, as it may obstruct emergency services access to other houses on the street, is flammable, and requires pedestrians to walk on the street.”  As of 10/26/2022, no violation of codes enforced by SDCI were seen related to the RV with a plywood shelter with tarps surrounding it on 14th Ave S due to the construction being located entirely in the public right-of-way (ROW). See the attached 10/26/2022 photos showing the construction and including the 10/18/2022 Notice posted by SPD.  Would you please investigate? Thank you, Victoria",SEA-Unauthorized Encampment,1

A while back the city cleared this dead end street of a huge bramble patch, planted beautiful cypress trees, and invited the neighbors to create a small park around the walking path. Children love to play and ride skooters here. We have a couple of memorial benches and it is an enjoyable environment to meet people.
Volunteers have worked long and hard to plant and tend primarily native plants using permaculture methods. All ages of people use the path and enjoy the park sometimes donating plants of their own. We have to bring water from our homes in the summer and we have kept most of the plants alive!

Months of drug addict encampments continue to have a magnet effect on Howell St. More tents every month. The city should compensate the residents that have to clean up the mess and deal with theft caused due to the city?s enabling of drug addiction. It feels like our neighborhood as been designated as the dumping ground.

Below our condo building in the Queen Anne green belt are the massive remains of what used to be an encampment. Trash, needles, all kinds of crap. Neighborhood kids sometimes wander down there into what is likely a site with very unsanitary waste. The entrance to the green belt is just a couple blocks down. I think it?s Blaine and 12th.

The encampment encroachers drilled holes in my gas tank to steal gas causing $4K+ In damage. This is only the latest instance of destruction of my property excluding 3 broken windows and stolen items from my car. Should I sue the city for the damages or can the city just clear those that committed this felony from the area? On the 70th block of Sand Point Way NE across from 7-11. They are constantly committing crimes. I guess I could try and extract $4k from them myself without the city?s help? Is that what you want? At this point I am willing to fix the problem by any means necessary.
